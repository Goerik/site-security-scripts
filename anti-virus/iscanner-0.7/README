= Installation:

    First of all make sure that Ruby is installed in your server.
    # ruby -v

	If Ruby wasn't installed, you can simply use yum package manager:
    # yum install ruby

    Or apt-get if you were using Ubuntu or any other Debian based distributions:
    # apt-get install ruby 

    Otherwise you can download Ruby and install it on your machine from:
    # http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

    iScanner does not require any external libraries and you do not need to
    install the program to be able to use it but we included installer you can
    use it to install and uninstall iScanner from your server using the
    following command:
    # ./installer -i

    This command will install iScanner in the default directory '/etc/iscanner'
    but you can change the installation directory using the '-d' option:
    # ./installer -i -d /opt/iscanner

    And easly uninstall iScanner by removing the the folder or using the
    following command:
    # ./installer -u


= Usage:

    -R		Use this option to scan a remote web page / website.
    # iscanner -R http://example.com

    -F		Use this option to scan a specific file.
    # iscanner -F /home/user/file.php

    -f		Use this option to scan a specific directory.
    # iscanner -f /home/user

    -e      This option will allow you to select specific file extensions for
            scanning, by default iScanner will scan [htm, html, php, js] if you
            wanted to scan other or specific extensions only:
    # iscanner -f /home/user -e htm:html

    -d      By default iScanner will load the latest version of signatures
            database in the folder, if wanted to use older or modified version
            of the database:
    # iscanner -f /home/user -d database.db

    -M      Using this option allows you to specify malware code and iScanner
            will automatically generate regex signature for it then scan the
            files / website you want (incase you wanted to scan for specific
            code or undetected malware!)
    # iscanner -M /home/user/malware_code.txt -f /home/user
    # iscanner -M /home/user/malware_code.txt -R http://example.com

    -o      Using this option will allow you to choose the name of the infected
            log file. If this option wasn't used the name of the infected log
            file will be in this format "infected-[TIME]-[DATE].log", if you
            wanted to select other name:
    # iscanner -f /home/user -o user.log

    -m      With this option you can tell iScanner to send a copy of the
            infected log to selected email address:
    # iscanner -f /home/user -m email@example.com

    -c      This option will clean the infected files by removing the malicious
            code only without deleting the infected files. Before using this
            option make sure to check the infected log to know what exactly
            iScanner is going to remove from each infected file.
    # iscanner -c infected.log

    -b      If you used this option iScanner will take backup from the infected
            files before cleaning it. You can find backup of the cleaned files
            in a folder have the name "backup-[TIME]-[DATE]".
    # iscanner -b -c infected.log

    -r      If you used the previous option when cleanning the infected log and
            something went wrong, use this option to restore the files from the
            backup directory.
    # iscanner -r backup/

    -a      Using this option will make iScanner clean every infected file
            automatically. This option could be dangerous if you didn't scan
            the folder before and you don't know the results.
    # iscanner -f /home/user -a

    -D      This option will make iScanner run in the debug mode, the option
            will be useful if you had problem while running iScanner.
    # iscanner -f /home/user -D

    -q      If you don't want to see any output from iScanner you can enable
            this option to make the program run in the quit mode.
    # iscanner -f /home/user -q

    -s      This option allows you to send malicious file to iScanner's
            developers for analyses. This will help us improve the signatures
            database and keeping it updated.
    # iscanner -s /home/user/malicious_file.html

    -U      With this option you can update iScanner and the signatures
            database to the latest version easily.
    # iscanner -U

    -u      This option will update the signatures database only instead of
            updating the whole program.
    # iscanner -u

    -v      This option will print iScanner's version and release date with
            the database version and it's release date too.
    # iscanner -v

    -h      This option will show the help message.
    # iscanner -h


= Database signatures

- - 0.0
  - (REGULAR EXPRESSION)
  - Signature comment.
  - <MU|LN>:<RE|LO>

    * The first line is the signature id '0.0'.

    * Options:
        MU --> Multiline regular expression.
        LN --> One line regular expression.
        RE --> Use the regular expression in remote (-R) and local scan.
        LO --> Use the regular expression in local scan only.


= Tips & Tricks:

    * You can easily modify the signatures database and have your own customized
      version by adding, removing or changing the regular expressions in the
      database.

    * If several websites on your server has been hacked, you can add signature
      to iScanner's database to make it locate all the hacked index pages in
      your server.

    * You can add iScanner to the cron jobs to make it scan you server every 24
      hours and send the infected log to your email address.

    * It is possible to configure your ftp server (PureFTPd for example) to make
      iScanner scan all the uploaded files by the users and send email alert if
      malicious file has been detected.
